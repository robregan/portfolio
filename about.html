<p class= "zebra"> Since High School, I have always had an interest in tinkering with my devices, from installing Game Boy Advanced emulators on my TI89 calculator, to jailbreaking my iPhone for a <i>much</i> better user experience. I've always had passion for building things in a way to improve what we have. I chose to persue carpentry, as I got the satisfaction of seeing the finished product of our hard work. Once the pandemic hit and construction work dried up, I realized I needed a change. I knew a little bit about the web dev field from my brother who is a .NET engineer, so I decided it was time for a career pivot. I utilized my time to learn fullstack JavaScript, because given the right enviroment, the possibilities of what you can create are endless! I have really been enjoying building wonderful web apps that provide value to my community.</p>
